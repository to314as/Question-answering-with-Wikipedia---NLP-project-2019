# Question-answering-with-Wikipedia---NLP-project-2019
We propose and explore a QA system based on data form Wikipedia and the Stanford Question Answering Dataset. We show different approaches to document retrival as well as reading. Including tf-idf and term frequency for retrival. Language models such as word2vec(glove), infersent(sentence2vec by fb research), Bert,... Furthermore to we apply different supervised as well as unsupervised approaches for the question answering aspect.
